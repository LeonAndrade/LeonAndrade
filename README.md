Hello, i'm Leon, curious thinkerer of all things.

I am fascinated about software, language, data and the myriad of things that emerge from being able to bind meaning to symbols and compute them.

I believe data and computation will continue to play a major role in the transformation of our languages and communication, shaping the present and future of many types of social structures. Information is a powerful yet misterious concept and we have barely tapped into its nature. 

From markets to ecosystems, and operating systems to social organizations, the properties of information enable the emergence of complexity, always balancing work and entropy in the eternal dance between chaos and order.

Meanwhile, I do my best to juggle with it in the context of corporate analytics.
