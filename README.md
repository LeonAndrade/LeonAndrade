# Hello there! I'm Leon 🌿

I'm a movement artist turned data analyst, growing fascinated about the role of computation in our lives and what "is" information as a universal property.

I believe that computational thinking and data literacy are fundamental to understand the world we are building.

Happy to meet you 🌞
