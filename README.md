Hello, i'm Leon, curious thinkerer of all things.

I am fascinated about software, language, data and the myriad of things that emerge from being able to bind meaning to symbols and compute them.

For the past some years I've been working with data, and have been involved all across the spectrum, from delivering regular operational dashboards to complex integration pipelines.

I believe data and computation will play a major role in the transformation of our languages and communication, shaping the present and future of many types of social structures. And I am eager to help evolve this next iteration of human interactions.

Information is a powerful and misterious thing, we have barely tapped into its nature. 

From markets to ecosystems, and operating systems to social organizations, the properties of information enable the emergence of complexity, always balancing work and entropy in the eternal dance between chaos and order.

Meanwhile, I do my best to juggle with it in the context of analytics.
