Hi, you can call me Leon.

I'm a data professional skilled in data engineering, automation of analytics, pipeline design and data modeling, outsite my professional landscape i'm also interested about web development and user experience.

When AFK i enjoy practicing movement 🤸‍♂ (parkour, gymnastics, climbing, martial arts, dance, you name it..), hanging out in nature 🌿 with my family and  dogs, and chill watching the sunset 🌤.

If you'd like to talk business and technology or just get to know more, please write to [hello@leonmatheus.com](mailto:hello@leonmatheus.com) and i'll be happy to get back to you 😀.
